Machine Learning and Data Science Tasks

Task1: Linkedin Profile Completion Task.

Task2: Simple Linear Regression.ipynb. Data: SampleSuperstore.csv
In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied.
This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.What will be predicted score if a student study for 9.25 hrs in a day?

Task3: K-Means Algorithm.ipynb. Data: iris.csv
From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually. 

Task4: Decision Tree.ipynb. Data: iris.csv
For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
